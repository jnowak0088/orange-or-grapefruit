# orange-or-grapefruit
Building a classyfier, which distinguishes oranges from grapefruits, based on some numerical variables.

The project consists of 3 files:

Citrus.csv - the database

code.ipynb - the Jupyter Notebook

Due to the size of the Jupyter Notebook, it may not render properly on GitHub. If so, I recommend to use https://nbviewer.org/ to open the project. If you have any thoughts about the project - please, inform me.

Thank you!
